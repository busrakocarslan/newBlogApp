## In my project, I used Redux to centralize the application state, track state changes, and facilitate state sharing between components. Redux Toolkit helped speed up the development process by allowing me to write less code. I created an Axios instance to centralize and manage general Axios code. To simplify form operations and validation, I used Formik and Yup, which made my code more aligned with the DRY principle. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS and Material UI. I established a hierarchical structure between pages using nested routing. With PrivateRouter, I ensured that only logged-in users can access certain pages. In my project, users cannot like or comment on blogs without logging in. Additionally, there is a section where they can review, edit, and delete their own blogs.
